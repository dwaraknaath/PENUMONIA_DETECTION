# PENUMONIA_DETECTION
The proposed work involves developing a machine learning model for automated pneumonia detection using chest X-ray images. This includes collecting a comprehensive dataset of labeled chest X-ray images, preprocessing the data to enhance quality and remove noise, and training the model using various machine learning algorithms, with a focus on deep learning techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The trained model was  evaluated on separate test datasets to assess its performance in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and overall **accuracy is 96%**.
