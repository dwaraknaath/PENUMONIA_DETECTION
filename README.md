# PENUMONIA_DETECTION
The proposed work involves developing a machine learning model for automated pneumonia detection using chest X-ray images. This includes collecting a comprehensive dataset of labeled chest X-ray images, preprocessing the data to enhance quality and remove noise, and training the model using various machine learning algorithms, with a focus on deep learning techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The trained model will then be evaluated on separate test datasets to assess its performance in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy. Additionally, the model will be compared against existing diagnostic methods to evaluate its effectiveness in clinical settings. Finally, the developed system will be optimized and potentially deployed in real-world healthcare environments to assist radiologists and clinicians in pneumonia diagnosis.
